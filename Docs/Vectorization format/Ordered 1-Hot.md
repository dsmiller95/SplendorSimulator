Similar to [[1-Hot]], but specifically used to establish an ordering among multiple options rather than picking exactly one.

In some cases, the list of options is used as a way to establish an ordering over all options. For example with a 1-Hot vector if size 4: `[0.3, 1.4, 0.1, 0.5]`  we can establish an ordering of options: 1, 3, 0, 2
